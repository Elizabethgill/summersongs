    <h1>Lose Control</h1>
    <h2>Teddy Swims</h2>
    <h3>Who is Teddy Swims?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, this is probably one of the better songs this summer - and that's coming from someone who doesn't listen to pop much. On the contrary, I have no clue who Teddy Swims or how he has so many Spotify followers with only one album. I kept having to look up who sings this.</p>
