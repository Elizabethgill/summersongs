    <h1>A Bar Song (Tipsy)</h1>
    <h2>Shaboozey</h2>
    <h3>The song gives Pharrell Williams' "Happy" and Lil Nas X "Old Town Road" cross over... and not in a good way</h3>
    <p>The song isn't bad per say, however, it sounds like a 2013 song. The first time I heard this song I thought it was 10-year-old song that was trending again and was surprised to find out it was not.

    <p>2/5</p>
